# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? 

Your answer: How is it different than functional programming? OOP is a computer programming model that organizes data and objects to make it easier to maintain. The output to Functional programming is the same as the inputs

Researched answer: OOP is a paradigm which uses objects to represent things you are programing, for example data structures, the objects hold data such as keys and values, and you can add more data to it while on the other hand FP works best with there is nothing else needed to be added to the function, for example getSum() and with preset input data.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integer would be a whole number, and a float would be one with a decimal, you can use an integer if you are dealing with whole numbers, but if you want to see tax, you would use a float. So use either or for your desired needs/ desired outcomes

Researched answer: Google basically said what I said so I think I hit this one right on the nail!

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? 

Your answer: A function that is returning values automatically without having the word "return" after the function.

Researched answer: Return is implied, mostly used when the function body has a single expression.

4. What is a block in Ruby? 

Your answer: Rubys anonymous function that is passed through a method to get the outcome, with keywords "do" and "end"

Researched answer: They can have multiple arugments.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You can either extract a single value by calling on the name of the corresponding key for example colors  { :red => 'apple', :blue => 'blueberries', :yellow => banana }
you would do p color[:yellow] output => 'banana'

you can also p colors => output { :red => 'apple', :blue => 'blueberries', :yellow => banana }

Researched answer: Hashes are basically like arrays but they do not have a number index, they have a key index that includes a string so just use square brackets to call on them with a colon before the key.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: Database management system that is opensource and free! We love free things. Funfact: it was previously named POSTGRES, and also it was developed at UC Berkeley

2. Ruby on Rails: Web application framework that uses Ruby, basically like what react is to javascript??

3. ORM: Object relational mapping - a technique that converts data in between type systems (uses OOP)

4. Active Record: Validation of the state of a model before it goes into the database, you can check if an attribute value is not empty, has a specific formatting.

5. Migrations: Movement of code inbetween different systems.
